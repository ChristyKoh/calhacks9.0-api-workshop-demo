# Codebase API Workshop Demos

Included in this repo are two demos for learning to use an API: one with the NASA API, and another with the Twitter API.

The Twitter demo can only be run if you obtain a developer API key. To work around the auth issue for demo purposes, I just copied an access key from the [Twitter API Playground](https://oauth-playground.glitch.me/) details. You'll need to similarly provide a key in order to run the code.
